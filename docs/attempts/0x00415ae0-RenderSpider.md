# RenderSpider (0x00415ae0, `src/legoland/spider_ride.c`)

**Best: 98.62%**. Kind: C.

File: `src/legoland/spider_ride.c`. Plain C.

Best: 98.62% (unchanged from the starting source).

## What still differs

Inside the `if (tile->id == elem->tile.id && (b = elem->rider)->flags & 0x80)` block, the original
schedules the loads differently:
- original: `ecx = DAT_0082c660.y`, `eax = 0`, `esi = b->person`, `adj.x = adj.y = 0`, then `eax = DAT_0082c660.x`,
  store `base.x` and `base.y`.
- ours: `eax = DAT_0082c660.x`, `ecx = DAT_0082c660.y`, `esi = b->person`, store `base.x`, then zero `adj`, then store `base.y`.

Every variant that changes the order (below) either leaves the same 98.62% or drops the score, because the change
also moves the branch displacements earlier in the function.

## Tried

| Date | Model | Change | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-07 | Haiku 5.5 (spider) | `Person *p;` declared at top, `p = b->person` moved after `base`/`adj` | 96.90% |
| 2026-10-07 | Haiku 5.5 (spider) | `Person *p = b->person` kept, `adj` zeroed before `base = DAT_0082c660` | 96.90% |
| 2026-10-07 | Haiku 5.5 (spider) | `p` declared at top, `base`, `adj` zero, then `p = b->person` | 98.62% (no change) |
| 2026-10-07 | Haiku 5.5 (spider) | No `Person *p` local; use `b->person->...` everywhere | 59.52% |
| 2026-10-07 | Haiku 5.5 (spider) | `base` copied field by field (`base.x = DAT.x; base.y = DAT.y`) | 98.62% (no change) |
| 2026-10-07 | Haiku 5.5 (spider) | Field-wise copy with `base.y` first, `base.x` after `adj` zero | 98.27% |

## Best

98.62% (the original source).

## Ideas not tried yet

- `Point adj = {0, 0};` brace initialisation at declaration instead of two assignments.
- Splitting the `if (b->field_35 == 1)` block so `adj` is zeroed inside the if/else.
