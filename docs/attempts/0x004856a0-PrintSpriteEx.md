# PrintSpriteEx (0x004856a0, `src/legoland/print_sprite.c`)

**Best: 96.64%**. Kind: C.

## What still differs

- `result = 1` is kept in `ecx` for the whole group path in the original (`mov ecx, 1` right after the y
  offset arithmetic; the count-zero exit returns `ecx`, while the loop exit returns literal `mov eax, 1`).
  Ours never keeps it in a register: MSVC folds the constant into the zero-count return.
- Because `ecx` is free in ours, `group->count` is loaded into `ecx` (original: `edx`), which changes the
  `test`/`jle` pair and the loop's count reload registers.
- Everything else (non-group path, mask loop, the calls) already lines up.

## Tried (don't repeat)

| Date | Who | Change | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-07 | Haiku agent | Move `result = 1` after the x/y offset lines | 96.64% (no change) |
| 2026-10-07 | Haiku agent | Move `result = 1` to just before the `group->count <= 0` check | 96.64% (no change) |

## Ideas not tried yet

- Make the non-group paths assign `result` and fall through to a shared `return result` so `result` is
  genuinely live across the branch (needs a restructure; check the non-group asm stays identical).
- Use a signed/unsigned change on `result` or the count comparison to influence which register is used for
  the count load.
