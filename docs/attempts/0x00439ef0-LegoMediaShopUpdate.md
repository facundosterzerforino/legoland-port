# LegoMediaShopUpdate (0x00439ef0, `src/legoland/shops.c`)

**Best: 80.11%**. Kind: C.

## What still differs

- The original shares the tail of `case 0` and `case 4`: `case 0` does `or byte [esi+0x62], 8` and falls into the `x = (x-2) << 8` block at offset 0x6c (jump table entry 4 is `start + 0x6c`). Ours has a separate `case 4`.
- The jump-table targets for cases 2 and 3 are 5 to 6 bytes further in ours, which shifts every later jump by a few bytes.
- The `rand() % 3` branches (cases 1 and 3) use a different branch order from the original (`cmp dl, 2` then `cmp dl, 1`, with the `== 2` arm placed before `== 1` in the original).

## Tried (don't repeat)

| Date | Who | Change | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-08 | Haiku agent (a5) | `case 0:` falls through (`/* fall through */`) into a shared `case 4:` body (the original's tail sharing) | 43.30% (much worse) |

## Best

80.11%, the version currently in the file (unchanged).

## Ideas not tried yet

- Fall through the other way: keep `case 4` as the first body and put `case 0`'s `flags |= 8` in front of it with `if (param_action == 0)`, so the tail is shared without changing the switch shape.
- Swap the `== 2` and `== 1` arms in the case 1 and case 3 `rand()` chains.
