# AddObjectToMap (0x0045dd80, `src/legoland/map_object.c`)

**Best: 99.10%**. Kind: C.

## What still differs

- At the y-loop join (after the inner x loop), the original reloads `rect.x0` into `eax` first
  (`mov eax, [esp+0x14]`), then `ebp` (`rect.x1`), then `edx` (y). Ours loads `ebp`, `edx`, then `eax`.
  That is the only difference left (two lines).

## Tried (don't repeat)

| Date | Who | Change | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-07 | Haiku agent | `tile` set with a single ternary instead of if/else | 99.10% (same) |
| 2026-10-07 | Haiku agent | `struct MapElement *tile` moved from the function top into the inner x-loop block | 99.10% (same) |

## Ideas not tried yet

- Restructure the outer `for (;;)` / `rect = *rect.next` so the x0 reload is emitted in the join block.
- Use `rect.x0` directly in the y-loop body instead of the `x` induction variable's initial value.
