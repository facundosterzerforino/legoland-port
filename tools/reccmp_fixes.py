"""Project-side fixes for reccmp false positives. Import this before comparing.

1. Immediates that look like addresses in one image only.

reccmp decides for each image on its own whether an immediate operand is an address: it is if the
value is a relocation target or falls inside any known symbol. Our image lays data out differently from
the original, so a plain constant can land inside a symbol in one image and not the other. Example:
`mov ebx, 0x7fffff` is byte-identical in both, but the original shows `EditCursor+5183` and ours shows
`0x7fffff`, so the line counts as a difference.

The fix: when an instruction's raw (unsanitized) text is identical in both images and at least one side
left the value as a plain number, the two lines count as equal. If both sides resolved the value to a
symbol, the line is left alone: that may be a real pointer mismatch.

2. Calls through a table: `call dword ptr [edx*4 + 0x4b9d44]`. reccmp names the displacement of
`[reg + address]` operands for every instruction except `call`, where it only handles a plain
`[address]`. So a call through a function-pointer table (ScriptEventHandlers[type](node)) always kept
its raw address, which differs between the images. The fix gives calls the same relocated-displacement
naming as every other instruction.

3. Pointers one past the end of an array: `cmp esi, 0x4be718` for `entry < &DAT_004bdeb8[0x86]`. The
address after an array is named after whatever symbol happens to follow it in that image (here
`___piob` in ours, nothing in the original). A line that still differs is rebuilt from the raw text on
both sides, naming each address that is not inside a symbol as `<symbol the byte before is in>+1`. If
both sides then read the same, the line is equal.

   The address may also sit a few bytes past the end (a loop over the second field of each pair ends at
   &arr[N].field): up to 32 bytes back are searched for the containing data symbol, skipping constants.

4. The `__try` scope table: `push -1; push <scopetable>; push __except_handler3`. The table is compiler
data that is never annotated, so its address is a plain number that differs between images. A `push`
of a plain number directly before `push __except_handler3` counts as equal.

5. Float constants reccmp only recognises in one image: `fmul dword ptr [<OFFSET1>]` against
`fmul dword ptr [0.015625 (FLOAT)]`. When a line that still differs only in addresses names a float
constant on one side, and the memory at each pair of addresses is identical (4 bytes, 8 for qword),
the line is equal.
